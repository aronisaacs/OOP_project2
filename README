1: for some reason the sound is not working, so it's disabled for now.
the code is correct, just my computer is being weird.
remember to enable it later!!

2: a lot of thought went into deciding which objects should receive the reference to the brickergamemanager.
in the end, only the collision strategy classes receive it, since they are the ones that need to trigger game
 state changes. it might be better to change this later, but it depends on how the game evolves.

the livesDisplay recieves only the add object reference to add its inner functions, which it uses only in its
constructor (it does not save this function as a field).

3: i wonder if i should add a ballCollisionClassStrategy, instead of having the ball handle its own collisions.
obviously all other collison strategies are about the bricks, so im not sure.
on the other hand, the CollisionStrategy interface is not really a "brick collision strategy" interface,
so maybe it would make sense to have a BallCollisionStrategy as well.
